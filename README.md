# 42 - Get Next Line

## About
Get Next Line is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum. This project focuses on creating a function get_next_line which retrieves next line from a file descriptor on each call.
Bonus tasks for this project are limiting declaring static variables to only one, and being able to read from multiple file descriptors at the same time.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
